  We are talking about as minute as watering plants every other week to critical business meetings.
  
  After logging into the application, users can create a board/room with names they like to give, and in that room they can create tickets.
  These tickets can be specifically categorized for description (debugging/task/chore/general) and urgency (chill/important/important/critical).
  The admin/creator of the room can add or invite another members and has accessability to set terms to display analytical graphs to monitor the status of all tickets.
